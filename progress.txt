Main factors to measure:
	
	1. Time period (Let's say 20 days, 10 days, 5 days, 1 day).
	2. LOC changed (modified, added, deleted)
.	3.1. Single developer or multiple developers have modified the file.
	3.2. Total number of developers who have modified the file during the given period of time.

PLAN for the project:

	1.	Clone repository locally;
	2.	Get log from the repository;
	3.	Parse commits to suitable format (CommitBean vector in this case);
	4.	Mine issues from issue tracker (Jira in this case);
		4.1.	Mining only "BUG" issues;
	5.	Get commits which fixed bugs;
	6.	Git diff on bug-fixed commits;
		6.1. Data needed:

			commit id
			modified lines numbers inside file
			@TODO remove test files!!
	7. Checkout to every commit which fixed bugs
	8.	Git blame on every file of bug-fixed commits:
		8.1. check every modified line one by one to see if there was one/more commits which modified those lines;
		8.2. Data needed:
			commit author
			date of commit
			commit id
		@TODO
	9.	Extract the history of every modified line;
	10.

How to deal with newly added files on commit which introduced a bug?
Ignore them.
