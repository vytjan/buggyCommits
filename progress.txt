10-20 ESM Project sketch

Main factors to measure:
	
	1. Time period (Let's say 20 days, 10 days, 5 days, 1 day).
	2. LOC changed (modified, added, deleted)
.	3.1. Single developer or multiple developers have modified the file.
	3.2. Total number of developers who have modified the file during the given period of time.

Task: Write a proposal (1-2p.) containing all the information, main purpose and the outcomes of the research.

PLAN for the project:

	1.	Clone repository locally;
	2.	Get log from the repository;
	3.	Parse commits to suitable format (CommitBean vector in this case);
	4.	Mine issues from issue tracker (Jira in this case);
		4.1.	Mining only "BUG" issues;
	5.	Get commits which fixed bugs;
	6.	Git diff on bug-fixed commits;
		6.1. Data needed:

			commit id
			modified lines numbers inside file
			@TODO remove test files!!
				Check for comments;
	7. Checkout to every commit which fixed bugs
	8.	Git blame on every file of bug-fixed commits:
		8.1. check every modified line one by one to see if there was one/more commits which modified those lines;
		8.2. Data needed:
			commit author
			date of commit
			commit id
		@TODO
	9.	Extract the history of every modified line;
	10.	



-------------Q------------
How to deal with newly added files on commit which introduced a bug?
Ignore them.


----------@TODO
Check for lines of whose only positions were changed (identic removed and added line)
Not include test files and .txt etc. - which not affect bugs in code


Presentation:
	Clear introduction on the goal, description and current status;
	near future plans (1 month);
	20 mins

QQQ How to count number of modified lines:
	|sum of (+++) lines - sum of (---) lines| ?
QQQ Do I need to count if the line was modified by a different author, or just a file was modified by the same/different author?



@TODO 
	Parse only java files as early as possible.
	Exclude commented lines;
	Divide git diff per file, because now to array are added modified lines from multiple files

QQQ if need to look for empty lines in git blame when finding buggy commit?
QQQ why git blame id's of commits are 8 dig, when log id's are 7 dig?
