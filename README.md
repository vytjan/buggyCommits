An empirical study on developer related factors introducing bugs in commits.

This empirical study focuses on the analysis of relations between bug inducing commits and specific factors: (i) number of days, (ii) number of commits, (iii) number of lines of code (LOC)changed and (iv) number of developers who modified the same 
file between a bug-inducing commit and the commit before it made by the same developer.
